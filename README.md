# Unity NEET Implementation

This project is an implementation of the NEET algorithm, developed by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen, within Unity.

## Installation

This is a Unity 6 project file with the default Library folder removed, therefore opening this folder in Unity 6 works fine.

## Best practice

When running the project, it is best to view in the scene view. This way you can see the raycasts from creatures, as well as move around.
